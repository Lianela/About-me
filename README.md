- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lianela
- 👀 I’m interested in web browsing and games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, C++, anything to be honest
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, open to what looks interesting
- 📫 How to reach me Discord, DM, anything... (I basically just edited this cuz I was bored to do something decent)

So, yeah, basically, programming my own web browser, right now on Alpha phase using Chromium, expect to change that in next week, so, it would be good to achieve that...

So, uh, that proyect died a months ago, so don't expect to see anything new, probably I will start a new one....

Also, I'm new here, at GitHub, so I don't understand a lot.

Basically, I speak English, Spanish, Korean and French, I can adapt quickly to other languages.
I'm 22 years old, I'm at Discord at jung29, so, yeah.
