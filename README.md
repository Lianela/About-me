- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lianela
- 👀 I’m interested in web browsing and games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, C++, anything to be honest
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, open to what looks interesting
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord, DM, anything... (I basically just edited this cuz I was bored to do something decent)

So, yeah, basically, programming my own web browser... ~right now on Alpha phase using Chromium, expect to change that in next week, so, it would be good to achieve that...~
<br>
<br>I was, basically due to time problems and that, it achieved a good point, able to browse internet, save things, have a good looking window, and good things, I was trying to do a hybrid browser between Gecko, Chromium and Tor.

So, uh, that proyect died a months ago, so don't expect to see anything new, probably I will start a new one....

Also, I'm new here, at GitHub, so I don't understand a lot.

Basically, I speak English, Spanish, Korean and French, I can adapt quickly to other languages.
I'm 22 years old, I'm at Discord at jung29, so, yeah.

Also, I'm proud of being a translator for any projects available, I can translate from any language to Spanish and English, usually I do this as a hobbie, so yeah... "Free" translation could be the word...

Projects that I'm helping translating:  

**Hydra Launcher** - Game Launcher with its own embedded BitTorrent Client.  
**Rockbox** - Free firmware for digital music players.  
**SignalRGB** - Control and sync your RGB with one free app.  

All of this, I'm proud of helping these projects, being all of them different things between each other but interesting to use, for my day, these are totally worth to take a look!
