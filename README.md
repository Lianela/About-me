- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lianela
- 👀 I’m interested in web browsing and games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, C++, anything to be honest
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, open to what looks interesting
- 📫 How to reach me Discord, DM, anything...

So, yeah, basically, programming my own web browser, right now on Alpha phase using Chromium, expect to change that in next week, so, it would be good to achieve that
